    "**2. Understand the data:** We should understand the data features, columns, and what they are representing. If needed, we should ask the experts in the field to get proper explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Checking data types:** We should check if the data types are correct. If the numbers are actually in a number format, or if dates are either in date/time format or a string.\n",
